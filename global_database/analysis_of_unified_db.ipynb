    "### 3. Based on database Earthquakes of Russia we understand that there are a lot of earthquakes with low magnitude. To formulate the right picture of tectonics in Laptev sea reagion we should also take in mind small events not only the big one. That is way we need extra information about local small events on the shelf of the Laptev Sea and in the Lena Delta."
