# Laptev Sea :sunglasses:

**Let me give you the basic understanding of my work. The area of my scientific interests is seismicity of Laptev sea region.**
What do I mean when I say Laptev sea region?
I mean the following geo rectangle.

**So, my work is divided into 3 main part.**
_First_, I need to collect available data of earthquakes which occurred in my region.
_Second_, I should process local wave-form data which I received due to the expedition on the russian research vessel ![Keldysh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademik_Mstislav_Keldysh) in Laptev sea.
_Third_, I am going to plot maps, graphics and make some scientific conclutions.
