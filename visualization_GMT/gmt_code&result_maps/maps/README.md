# Maps 

Here you can find the result of plotting maps.

You now know how to plot

1.Location of Stations (stations.bat)

2.Distribution of earthquakes (unified_db.bat)

3.Focal Mechanism (focmec.bat)

It's up to you how to upgrade the given code (thank to variety of extra parameters http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/latest/index.html).
